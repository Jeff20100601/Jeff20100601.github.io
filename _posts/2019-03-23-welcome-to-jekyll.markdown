Greetings! I am a first-year Ph.D. student at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, supervised by Prof. Volker Tresp. I have a background in data analysis & computer vision and
finished my master’s degree at the Technical University of Munich in 2019 focusing on robotics,
cognition, and intelligence. Prior to the Ph.D. study, I wrote my master’s thesis at the Research Group Machine Intelligence of Siemens Corporate Technology where I worked on deep learning of point processes for reasoning on temporal knolwedge graphs. 

My research interests include machine learning for temporal (knowledge) graphs, geometric deep learning and time series analysis. I welcome opportunities for collaboration.

```javascript
const Razorpay = require('razorpay');

let rzp = Razorpay({
	key_id: 'KEY_ID',
	secret: 'name'
});

// capture request
rzp.capture(payment_id, cost)
	.then(function (data) {
		return 2;
	})
```
