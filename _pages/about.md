I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student at the [Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich](https://www.mathematik-informatik-statistik.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) & [Siemens AG](http://www.siemens.com), advised by [Prof. Volker Tresp](http://www.dbs.ifi.lmu.de/~tresp) at the [Research Group Machine Intelligence](https://www.siemens.com/innovation/en/home/pictures-of-the-future/digitalization-and-software/autonomous-systems-munich-hackathon.html) of [Siemens Corporate Technology](https://www.siemens.com/global/en/home/company/innovation/corporate-technology.html). My research interests include machine learning, especially deep learning and reinforcement learning, and their application to computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics. In particular, I am interested in improving the sample-efficiency of current reinforcement learning algorithms and apply them to solve real-world tasks.

Prior to joining Siemens AG & LMU Munich, I received my master's degree in [Robotics, Cognition, Intelligence](https://www.in.tum.de/en/for-prospective-students/masters-programs/robotics-cognition-intelligence-msc/) from the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de) in 2016. I also spent seven months at the [Institute of Robotics and Mechatronics](https://www.dlr.de/rm/en/) of the [German Aerospace Center (DLR)](https://www.dlr.de/dlr/en/) conducting my master's thesis. Under the supervision of [Haider Ali](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-haider-ali-ab6b76b) and [Patrick van der Smagt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/smagt), I worked on deep learning for action recognition in 3D videos.
