Greetings! I am a first-year Ph.D. student at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, supervised by Prof. Volker Tresp. I have a background in data analysis & computer vision and finished my master’s degree at the Technical University of Munich in 2019 focusing on robotics, cognition, and intelligence. Prior to the Ph.D. study, I wrote my master’s thesis at the Research Group Machine Intelligence of Siemens Corporate Technology where I worked on deep learning of point processes for reasoning on temporal knolwedge graphs.

My research interests include machine learning for temporal (knowledge) graphs, geometric deep learning and time series analysis. I welcome opportunities for collaboration.
